# 👨‍💻 Ajay's Data Science Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal **Data Science Journey**, where I'm learning and applying concepts from the [CodeWithHarry Data Science Course].
This repository will be updated consistently with notes, code, and mini-projects as I grow in the field of Data Science.

## 🧠 Why I'm Learning Data Science

As a 3rd-year CSE student with a **minor degree in Data Science**, I'm deeply interested in data-driven decision making and solving real-world problems with the power of data. 
Data Science combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge — and I love that blend!
